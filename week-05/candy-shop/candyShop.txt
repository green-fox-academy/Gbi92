### Candy shop

You are going to create a Candy shop where we sell hard candies and lollipops.

#### Sweet

- It has a type, a price and an amount of sugar.

##### Lollipop

- Its type is `lollipop`, price is $10 and it made from 5 grams of sugar.

##### Hard candy

- Its type is `hardCandy`, price is $20 and it made from 10 grams of sugar.

#### Candy shop

- It has sugar, income, and an `inventory` (list of sweets).

- It takes an amount of sugar in gram when creating an instance.

- It has a `createSweet()` method which takes `Sweet` as a parameter

  - and store it in the `inventory`
  - the `sugar` amount gets reduced by the amount needed to create the sweets

- It has a `raise()` method which takes an `amount` as a parameter

  - raise the prices of all the sweets in the `inventory` with the `amount`

- It has a `sell()` method which takes an `amount` and a `type` as parameter

  - the income will be increased by the price of the sweets
    and we delete it from the inventory

- It has a `buySugar()` method which takes an `amount` as parameter

  - price of 1000 grams sugar is $100

  - it raises the Candy Shop's amount of sugar
    and reduces the income by the price of it

  - the income can't go below 0

- It has a `toString()` method which represents the Candy Shop

  - return a string in this format:

    - `Inventory: 3 hard candies, 2 lollipops, Income: $100, Sugar: 400 grams`
